# Mobile Geo Data Viewer

*Note: This software is a CouchApp*

CouchApps are web applications which can be served directly from [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org). This gives them the nice property of replicating just like any other data stored in CouchDB. They are also simple to write as they can use the built-in jQuery libraries and plugins that ship with CouchDB.

I've written a [case study documenting how we did this for the City of Boston](http://mertonium.com/2011/09/a-data-liberation-walkthrough/).  You should have at least [these fields](https://github.com/mertonium/public_art_finder/blob/master/public_art_finder_template.json) in your documents.
